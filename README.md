Build a Python game

GUESS THE COUNTRY
I decided to create a variation on the classic Hangman game. I started off by creating a very basic version of the game, and then gradually improving it with additional code.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
- Add list comprehension
- Improve the appearance of the user interaction/output (different colours, bold/italics, images, etc.)
- Allow for users to input uppercase letters rather restricting to only lowercase
- Add countries with more than 1 word in their name (allow whitespaces)
- Print out the letters correctly guessed in a 'Hangman' style (eg: B _ _ z i l)
